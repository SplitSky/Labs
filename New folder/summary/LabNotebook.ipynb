    "# About this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a Python notebook. This is the notebook you'll use to run the analysis code on data sets of your choice, and also to view the resulting histograms from your analysis. This Jupyter notebook is composed of three sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Executing the *RunAnalysis.py* script which will utilise the current version of *Analysis.py* on your user area to analyse specific data sets of your choosing, and generate histograms from these data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reading in .root files containing the histograms you made from running the *RunAnalysis.py* script, so that you can view them and extract useful numerical information from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A template for making stacked plots from histograms you have created.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is your first time using Jupyter Notebook, and have any questions on how it works, please consult the online user documentation [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html). The 'help' button on the Menu bar at the top of this notebook also contains links to useful online documentation as well as a handy 'User Interface Tour'. ROOT code is used in Sections 2 and 3 of this notebook. If you have any queries concerning the functionality of the ROOT code, you can look specific functions in the [Official ROOT Reference Documentation](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/index.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "One important point to note about using Jupyter notebook is that not all the notebook has to be run every time you want to run any part of the code - each cell can be run seperately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:** Please read and try all three sections of this notebook **before** making any edits to *Analysis.py*, and make sure you understand the functionality of each section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:** It is strongly recommended that only **one** student of a lab pair should edit this notebook and the files contained within the server directories. This is because both students cannot see the same live edit of the notebook or files at the same time, and it is easy to accidently overwrite each other.\n"

    "# Section 1: Executing RunAnalysis.py\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this section there is only a single cell which will execute *RunAnalysis.py* when ran. Open running this cell you will be prompted with instructions for how to choose what data sets you analyse, and how much of these data sets you wish to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "The cell must be run every time you want to analyse a data set, but be careful - once you have executed the script, output files related to the data sets you used will be generated in the *out* folder within the *ATLAS-Project* directory. If you were to run the script again for the same data sets, the .root files containing your histograms will be overwritten. Therefore it is **essential** to change the names of the .root files you make to something unique, and is clear to what the file refers to (e.g what data set, what selection cuts, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another crucial point to note: *RunAnalysis.py* will not necessarily use the latest saved version of *Analysis.py*. In order to ensure that the most recent version is used, you **must** restart your kernel before running *RunAnalysis.py* after making changes to *Analysis.py*. You can do this from the 'Kernel' tab on the Menu bar at the top of this notebook. If you have not changed *Analysis.py* since last running the script, there is no need to restart your kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test the cell below, run it and type \"Zee\" when prompted for the string code, and type \"yes\" when prompted if you want to run the analysis using the 1% of the entire data set."

For future reference, more string codes for different data sets are shown in Table 4 of the Lab script. The full (rather long) list of available data sets can be found in *dataSets.py* in the sub-directory *backend*.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can tell *RunAnalysis.py* to analyse more than one data set by responding to the prompt with a list of string codes separated by commas. Histograms for each data set will be plotted in separate .root files. Sometimes it is useful to analyse more than one data set and add the results to form a single set of histograms. You can do this by responding to the prompt with string codes separated by plus signs ('+').\n",

    "# Section 2: Viewing your histograms\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this section there are 3 cells which all contain 3 different parts of the code structure for viewing histograms. The reason the code is split into 3 cells is that not all the cells need to be executed together. The cell structure for this section is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Making essential imports, such as allowing Python to use ROOT\n",
    "2. Opening .root files and retrieving the histograms stored within\n",
    "3. Printing the histograms\n",
    "\n",
    "When viewing your own histograms you will need to edit the code in both the second and third cell for your specific .root files. This includes the .root file names, the histogram names, and choosing what histograms you view.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third cell is set up so that when using the default version of *Analysis.py*, you are reading in the file *Zee_fast.root* that you will have created in Section 1 of this notebook. From this file you are viewing two of the histograms made: *h_3lep_pt* and *h_lep_mean_pt*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A note about the third cell: Here TCanvas is used for each histogram you would like to plot. Whenever you want to plot anything with ROOT you use a TCanvas. One is created by default, but it is always useful to create your own so that you can manipulate it better. For more information on TCanvas, please click [here](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTCanvas.html). The third shell is also an example of showing two histograms from the .root file, it can easily be extended to view as many as needed."
